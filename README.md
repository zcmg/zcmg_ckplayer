The CK Player System is a script developed for FiveM servers using the ESX framework, allowing administrators to perform CKs (Character Kills) on players in a permanent and secure way.

With a simple interface and straightforward commands, the system completely removes the selected character from the database, ensuring it can no longer be used. It's ideal for roleplay situations where a character needs to be permanently eliminated.
